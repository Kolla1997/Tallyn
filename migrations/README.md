# migrations

SQL schema for Supabase, applied in filename order: `NNNN_short_name.sql` (e.g. `0001_households.sql`).

Rules (see `CLAUDE.md` §7):
- Turn on row-level security for every table, and add its policies in the same migration.
- Never put real account data in a migration. Use obviously fake seed data.

The first schema lands with #6.
